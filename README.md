# university_enrolment_application
This application simulates a university enrollment system. 
 - The application stores a collection of students and papers that can either be read in via a file or entered by the user.
 - The application has the functionality to save run time data. It can also load the saved data back into memory. The data is saved in Json format.
It took 15 hours of coding and was the first time I had worked with a Json structure.
